Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique used to analyze data from a study in which a researcher wishes to examine both the separate and the combined effects of two categorical independent variables, called factors, on a continuous dependent (or
outcome) variable. This entry first describes the data analytic context for ANOVA and the logic behind its implementation. Two-way ANOVA is then introduced and several key analytic elements are discussed in the context of a real data example.
