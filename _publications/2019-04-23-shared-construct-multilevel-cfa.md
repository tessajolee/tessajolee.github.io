When modeling multilevel data, often a "shared" construct of interest is measured by individual-level observations, for example, therapy clientsâ€™ responses regarding their clinician's communication style. In the literature, however, shared constructs like communication style are typically modeled incorrectly. To faciliate improved modeling of shared constructs, we describe multilevel confirmatory factor analysis models applied to data drawn from individuals rating cluster-level outcomes. We discuss technical issues related to model identification using a population analysis and a simulation study, and we present a real data illustration to demonstrate best-practice modeling strategies.
