excerpt: 'Time to Criterion (T2C) latent growth models allow researchers to directly model the time it takes for individuals to achieve criteria of interest. T2C models do not require discretization of data, as do survival models, and they yield flexibility in specification of a theoretical change process by placing "time" within the larger structural equation modeling framework. <a href = "/files/T2C Latent Growth Models_WM.pdf">PDF</a>'

We draw upon a framework of longitudinal models called latent growth models, and we utilize a technique called reparameterization to specify time itself as a construct of interest, with a set of associated estimable parameters. The resulting Time to Criterion (T2C) models are flexible enough to incorporate both predictors and outcomes of time and easily address missingness and other complex data issues.
