Welcome! I am a third-year PhD student in quantitative methods at UMD. I generally look at the quant world from the comfort of the structural equation modeling framework. Within that, my research generally falls into three buckets: longitudinal modeling, social network data, and clustering and classification. Sometimes I get wild and mix them all together.
